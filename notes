Setup tasks that can't be scripted

- Allow root access without password:

Run `visudo`
At the end insert `tim ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL`

- Other
Add passwd to root user, same as local user, so that i3lock doesn't completely lock me out if I accidently run it as root. 

# Disable nautilus desktop background:
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false


# Fixing Hibernate on HP Elitebook
sudo echo "HandleLidSwitchDocked=suspend" &>> /etc/systemd/logind.conf
