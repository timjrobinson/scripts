Setup tasks that can't be scripted

- Allow root access without password:

Run `visudo`
At the end insert `tim ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL`

- Other
Add passwd to root user, same as local user, so that i3lock doesn't completely lock me out if I accidently run it as root. 


TODO
- pavucontrol
- atom
- skype
- tzupdate
-- sudo apt-get update install python-pip
-- sudo pip install tzupdate (I had to fully switch to root instead of just running this)
-- sudo tzupdate
- solaar (software for pairing logitech mice with PC)
