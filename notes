Run `visudo`
At the end insert `tim ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL`

# Setting up terminal:
- Install zsh following https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH
- Install oh-my-zsh following http://ohmyz.sh/

Edit .zshrc:
- Add `source ~/scripts/omz-include` just after the `export ZSH=` 
- Add `source ~/scripts/include-zshrc` after `source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh`
